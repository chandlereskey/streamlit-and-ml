# streamlit-and-ml
Streamlit application. Todo page and Number Prediction page

The purpose of this project was to learn streamlit at a high level and also implement a ML model and use it in a streamlit application.


Steps to run the streamlit app: 

1. Clone repo
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. in terminal, run: streamlit run streamlit-app/main.py

When using pycharm and venv I ran into some issues running. To help with this, go to File>Settings>Tools>Terminal, select the shell path you want to use (I am using bash), make sure that Activate virtualenv is on then restart pycharm. 
If Activate virtualenv is already checked, turn it off, click apply, turn it back on, click apply and okay then restart pycharm.
